<h1>	➢ Feasibility study</h1>
<h2>
	• Technical feasibility:-

				The technical feasibility always focuses on existing computer hardware ,software and so personnel. It needs to consider the machine availability nature of hardware & software being used. System is portable since it can be used on any machine & no additional hardware is required
				The project backend is PostgreSQL.

	• Economical feasibility:-
					
				It considered the cost/benefit analysis of the proposed project the benefits are always expected to over weighting the costs. Economical feasibility is helpful to find the system development cost & check whether it is justifiable that we it checks.

	• Operational feasibility:-
				
				It consider the acceptability of system it checks whether sys be used if it is developed and implementation are uses of the system able to handle the system Whether the proposed system causes anytrouble or not,etc Various costs carried by system.

				1. Technical experts consulting costs
				2. Equipment purches cost
				3. Communication equipment cost
				4. Operating system software cost
				5. Application software cost
				6. Documentation preparation cost
				The system delveloped will be user friendly....
